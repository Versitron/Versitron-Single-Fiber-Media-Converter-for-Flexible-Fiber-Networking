## What is a Single Fiber Media Converter?

A single fiber media converter enables data transmission and reception over a single optical strand by using wavelength-based bi-directional signaling. This allows full-duplex communication without requiring separate fibers for transmit and receive. Organizations use these converters to extend Ethernet links beyond copper limits, simplify fiber infrastructure, and improve overall network performance.
